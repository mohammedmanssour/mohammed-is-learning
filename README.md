# Hi, I'm Mohammed

I am a Full-stack web developer with +8 years of experience in the field. I love to turn great ideas into beautiful, fully functional experiences. I am passionate about gaming and definitely passionate about backend engineering.

As a Full Stack developer, **PHP** was the language I chose to start with as a backend programming language, supported with a big passion, and very good experience in **Laravel**. I also work with other languages like JS and Go. On the other hand, I am very much into frontend technologies, mostly **React.js, TypeScript**, and CSS for sure.
