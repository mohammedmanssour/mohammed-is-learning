# Mohammed is learning

I made this repository to gather all the projects that I've built/been building for learning reasons in one place, and to keep track of what I've learned/been learning. Also, this repository is a proof that I meet the skills mentioned in my resume.

The repository has main sections:

1. **Things from scratch**: I build projects and/or technologies from scratch to better understand how a technology works or to deepen my knowledge in the programming language used in the project.
   This kind of projects can be found in `things-from-scratch` folder.

2. **Other projects**: Here I build projects using frameworks to deepen my knowledge in the framework used, to apply different types of architectures, or to test libraries or technologies.

### Things from scratch

1. [RESTFUL api with **Node.js**](https://github.com/mohammedmanssour/mohammed-is-learning/blob/master/things-from-scratch/restful-api-with-plain-node/README.md). no 3rd party packages were used.
