# Hi, I'm Mohammed

I am a Full-stack web developer with +8 years of experience in the field. I love to turn great ideas into beautiful, fully functional experiences. I am passionate about gaming and definitely passionate about backend engineering.

As a Full Stack developer, **PHP** was the language I chose to start with as a backend programming language, supported with a big passion, and very good experience in **Laravel**. I also work with other languages like JS and Go. On the other hand, I am very much into frontend technologies, mostly **React.js, TypeScript**, and CSS for sure.

## How I Work

I wrote a little piece on how it's like to work with me. Find it at [Work with me](https://mohammedmanssour.me/blog/work-with-me/)

## Projects
I have signed NDAs with my previous/current employers, so, sadly, I can't share my professional work with you, but I build projects in my free time. Most of these projects help me explore ideas or act as a proof of concept that I'm familiar with a language, technology, library, or framework. These projects can be categorized into two main categories:

1. **Projects From scratch**: I build projects and/or technologies from scratch to better understand how technology works or to deepen my knowledge in the programming language used in the project. Find these projects at [things from scratch](https://github.com/mohammedmanssour/mohammedmanssour/tree/master/things-from-scratch).
  
2. **Other projects**: Here I build projects using frameworks to deepen my knowledge in the framework used, to apply different types of architectures, or to test libraries or technologies. Find these projects at [Other](https://github.com/mohammedmanssour/mohammedmanssour/tree/master/others).
