# Mohammed is learning

I made this repository to gather all the projects that I've built previously in one place to keep track of what I've learned/ been learning. Also, this repository is proof that I meet the skills mentioned in my resume.

The repository has main sections:
1. **Things from scratch**: I build projects, technologies from scratch to better understand how a technology works or to deepen my knowledge in a programming language used in the project.
This kind of projects can be found in `things-from-scratch` folder.

2. **Other projects**: Here I build projects using frameworks to deepen my knowledge in the framework used, to apply different types of architectures, or to test libraries or technologies.
